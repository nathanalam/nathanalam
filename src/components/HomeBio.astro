            <p>
                I'm a Software Engineer and a current MS/MBA candidate at
                Harvard. My background is in building impactful software at
                companies like Scale AI, Amazon (on AWS and Project Kuiper), and
                SpaceX.
            </p>
            <p>
                I graduated from Princeton University with a B.S. in Chemical
                and Biological Engineering and minors in Computer Science and
                Health Policy. I'm passionate about entrepreneurship and solving
                deep tech problems, especially in AI, robotics, and
                manufacturing.
            </p>

                This is my personal blog where I document my projects, share
                what I'm learning, and explore the intersection of technology
                and business.
